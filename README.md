WhyModern ?
-----
Alan Turing is considered to be the father of modern computing , at his time electro-mechanical machines were used to perform computations.This is a software implementation with enhanced features to prevent some  weakness points in original Enigma that allowed Turing to crack it .

Features:
---
* Dynamic configuration of the machine based on Model Token , thus no single machine with fixed wiring that can be reverse engineered 
* A new random per msg setting is setup for the operator , eliminating the lazy habits for not changing machine offset per message 
* More Rotors and more special characters used , to increase the key space   
* After all , it's just a software you can curry easily , it's just some lines of code ;)
